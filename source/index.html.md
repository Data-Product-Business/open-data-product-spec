# Open Data Product Specification

Technical specification of a machine-readable data product metadata model, which enables interoperability between operators, marketplaces, and tools. 

**Note!** In the "Open Data Product" focus is on the latter words and the prefix 'open' refers to openness of the standard. Any kind of connotations to open data (different thing) are not intentional, intended or desirable. 

This is work in progress. 

## Middle column: Principles and components

The middle column contains detailed information about the included components and related options. This is the theory part. 

Note! Mandatory elements and attributes are marked with **bold names** and **\*** in the definition tables. 

## Right column: Examples

The right column contains JSON formatted examples of how the specification is used. 

> Example of JSON formatted snippet from the Open Data Product specification:

```javascript
"monitoring": {

  "url": "https://monitoring.com"
}
```

<aside class="notice">
The JSON examples are not based on any real data product, but exemplify the usage of Open Data Product Specification.
