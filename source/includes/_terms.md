| Data as a service  | [In computing, data as a service, or DaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_as_a_service), is a term used to describe cloud-based software tools used for working with data, such as managing data in a data warehouse or analyzing data with business intelligence. It is enabled by software as a service (SaaS). DaaS like all "as a service" (aaS) technology, builds on the concept that its data product can be provided to the user on demand, regardless of geographic or organizational separation between provider and consumer. <br/><br/> [According to Daniel Newman from Forbes (2017)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2017/02/07/data-as-a-service-the-big-opportunity-for-business/) DaaS is essentially a data stream that subscribers can access on demand.

Some people use the term data product in a meaning which contains also data commodities which have more service alike attributes than product attributes. In those cases we prefer to use the term *data as a service* and call the creation process as *data servitization*. The term *productizement* is reserved for the process which creates data products as end result. |
| Data as a service business model |  Data as a service as a business model is a concept when two or more organizations buy, sell, or trade machine-readable data in exchange for something of value. Data as a service is a general term that encompasses data-related services. Now DaaS service providers are replacing traditional data analytics services or happily clustering with existing services to offer more value-addition to customers. The DaaS providers are curating, aggregating, analyzing multi-source data in order to provide additional more valuable analytical data or information. <br/><br/> Typically, DaaS business is based on subscriptions and customers pay for a package of services or definite services. |
