# Data Pipeline

Data Pipeline is a process whereby a data product pipeline deployment method is defined. Usually the deployment script contains the logic of the individual steps as well as the code chaining the steps together.

Data Pipeline enables building, deploying, and running the data productâ€™s code, and storing and giving access to data and metadata. This priciple has been adopted from the [Data Mesh](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-a-data-mesh-and-how-not-to-mesh-it-up-210710bb41e0).
